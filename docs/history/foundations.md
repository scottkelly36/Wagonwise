# Foundations — pre-coding and architecture-review decisions

## Decisions made before coding (from planning)

- Architecture mirrors day-job pattern: one core service (source of truth) + thin BFF per client.
- Clean architecture + DDD; modular monolith with `identity`, `routing`, `hazards` contexts.
- Valhalla for truck routing behind a `RoutingEngine` port; GraphHopper as fallback.
- Hands-free voice reporting is essential (primary way to report while driving), with
  confirm-before-filing. Tap-to-drop stays for parked use.
- Phase 0 (sample-network prototype) is done; skipping straight to real maps.
- Name WagonWise — finalised 2026-09-25: UK IPO trademark search came back clear, and
  `wagon-wise.com`/`.co.uk`/`.app` are bought (registrar: Spaceship).

## Decisions from architecture review (2026-09-21)

Taken before M1 so they don't have to be retrofitted. Full detail in
`docs/phase-1-tech-design.md`; the enforceable ones are rules in `CLAUDE.md`.

1. **Auth: core issues, BFF verifies.** Ed25519 asymmetric signing — core holds the private
   key, BFF reads the public key from core's JWKS. The BFF is physically unable to mint a
   token, so "BFFs contain no business rules" is a property of the system, not a convention.
   Access token 15 min, refresh 60–90 days with rotation and reuse detection. Core derives
   `driverId` from the token signature, never from a BFF-supplied field.
2. **Cross-context reads use a read-model port owned by the consuming context**, with its
   own types, translated by an adapter in that context's `infrastructure/`. Routing never
   sees a `HazardReport`. Enforced by dependency-cruiser in CI.
3. **`applies(obstruction, dimensions)` is a pure routing-domain function.** PostGIS filters
   candidates spatially; the domain decides whether a restriction affects a given vehicle.
   The height comparison never goes into SQL. Most safety-critical function in Phase 1.
4. **Transactions:** aggregates collect events, `repository.save()` writes rows + outbox in
   one transaction. A `UnitOfWork` port exists only for multi-aggregate operations.
5. **Outbox dispatch:** in-process poller, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, at-least-once delivery.
   Every handler idempotent, guarded by `outbox.handled (event_id, handler_name)`.
   Backoff, dead-letter after 5 attempts, `drainOnce()` for tests.
6. **Errors:** hand-rolled `Result<T, E>` for expected failures (keeps domain dependency-free),
   exceptions for bugs and infra faults. Tagged domain errors mapped to HTTP in one table.
7. **Branded ID types**, mirrored as zod brands in `packages/contracts`.
8. **Config read in one place** (`apps/core/src/config.ts`, zod-validated). Manual composition
   root per module, no DI container.
9. **Feedback is its own small module**; invite codes belong to Identity.
10. **No RoutePlan lifecycle in Phase 1.** Alerts cover active trips plus plans created in the
    last 6 hours. Add `plannedFor` only if testers actually plan the night before.
11. **Service-to-service auth:** private networking plus a rotatable `X-Internal-Key` with
    constant-time compare. Two valid keys accepted at once. mTLS deferred.
12. **Persistence:** Kysely for queries, raw SQL migrations (PostGIS geography + GiST indexes).
13. **CI tiering:** per-PR runs lint/typecheck/architecture/unit/application/PostGIS;
    Valhalla golden routes run nightly and on map rebuild against prebuilt tiles.
14. **Schema additions:** `identity.sessions`, `identity.invite_codes`, `feedback.notes`,
    `outbox.handled`.
